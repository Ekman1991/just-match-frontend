    "faq.general.question_3": "How do you use the service?",
    "faq.general.answer_3": "It's a piece of cake. 1) An employer registers a job on our system, (1-2 minutes). 2) A job-seeker finds a job, (>1 minute). 3) The employer reviews and selects a job-seeker, (1-3 minutes). 4) The job-seeker confirms that he or she will do the job, (>1 minute). 5) Both parties confirm that the job has been done, (>1 minute).",
    "faq.general.question_4": "How much does it cost to use JustArrived?",
    "faq.general.answer_4": "The service is free to use. We do not charge for arranging jobs. Rather, the money that is invoiced goes to employers after we have paid social charges, insurance and charges for third party services, (>5%).",
    "faq.general.question_5": "How do you set wage levels?",
    "faq.general.answer_5": "Answer: Wage levels are based on union recommendations. You can choose between SEK104/hr., SEKXXX/hr., or SEKXXX/hr. We believe that it is important that the jobs we provide are reasonably paid.",
    "faq.general.question_6": "Are taxes and social charges paid?",
    "faq.general.answer_6": "Answer: Yes, we pay employer contributions and insurance charges for all our employers.",
    "faq.general.question_7": "How do I change my profile?",
    "faq.general.answer_7": "Answer: To change your profile, you first click on the menu in the top right-hand corner of the app. Then click on your profile image at the bottom of the menu",
    "faq.user.title": "Job-seeker FAQ",
    "faq.user.question_1": "What do I need to do to take a job?",
    "faq.user.answer_1": "Answer: You need to have a valid personal number/co-ordination number, a work permit and access to a bank account.",
    "faq.user.question_2": "Do I need to have a bank account to look for jobs?",
    "faq.user.answer_2": "Answer: No, you do not. However, you do need to have access to a bank account because wages are not paid in cash.",
    "faq.user.question_3": "Why must I \"Accept\" a job offer when I have already searched for it?",
    "faq.user.answer_3": "Answer: We ask you to accept a job so that we know that you will do it. ",
    "faq.user.question_4": "How do I rebook a job if I am unable to do it at the agreed time?",
    "faq.user.answer_4": "Answer: If you are unable to do a job which you have accepted, you need to contact the employer and agree a new time. We recommend that you keep to the time that you both agreed on when you accepted the job.",
    "faq.user.question_5": "Can I pull out of a job that I have accepted?",
    "faq.user.answer_5": "Answer: If you do not want to do a job that you have accepted, you need to contact the employer, and help@justarrived.se so we can cancel the job.",
    "faq.user.question_6": "Why do I need to \"Approve\" when I have completed a job?",
    "faq.user.answer_6": "Answer: You approve a job so that we know that it has been completed. As soon as both parties have confirmed that a job has been completed, we can send an invoice and start the wage payment process.",
    "faq.user.question_7": "What should I do if a job takes longer to complete than advertised?",
    "faq.user.answer_7": "Answer: We recommend that you work for the amount of time given in the job description. If the job needs more time to complete, we would encourage you to discuss this with your employer and try to resolve the situation yourselves. We are reviewing the option of adding a function to the platform to add hours to jobs.",
    "faq.user.question_8": "May I send someone else to do a job on my behalf?",
    "faq.user.answer_8": "Answer: No. If you decide to do a job, you have a contract with the employer. This contract, and our terms and conditions, govern insurance and the payment of social charges for you, as named in the contract. It is therefore not possible to allow someone else to do a job on your behalf.",
    "faq.user.question_9": "When are wages paid?",
    "faq.user.answer_9": "Answer: Once both parties have confirmed that a job has been completed, it takes 10 working days for wages to be paid. ",
    "faq.company.title": "Employer FAQ",
    "faq.company.question_1": "Can I create jobs as a private individual?",
    "faq.company.answer_1": "Answer: You need to have a company number to use the service. This is a conscious requirement on our part because we want to give job-seekers the opportunity of making contact with potential employers.",
    "faq.company.question_2": "What type of job may I upload?",
    "faq.company.answer_2": "Answer: JustArrived supports jobs for some 2,000 professions, (for a complete list click here). For insurance reasons, you may not upload jobs for professions such as tattooists, surgeons, couriers etc. ",
    "faq.company.question_3": "May I edit a job if its conditions change?",
    "faq.company.answer_3": "Answer: You may not change a job once you have registered it. If a change involves minor details such as start time or address, we recommend that you contact the job-seeker directly to resolve the issue. If, however, you need to change the type of job, or the number of hours a job will take, we recommend that you remove the job and upload a new one.",
    "faq.company.question_4": "How do I communicate with candidates before I have hired anyone?",
    "faq.company.answer_4": "Answer: You can chat with job-seekers who have searched for the job on the app. The chat function supports Google Translate.",
    "faq.company.question_5": "How do I rebook a job-seeker if I am unable to offer a job at the agreed time?",
    "faq.company.answer_5": "Answer: You can not change your job after you have registered it. If a change involves minor details such as start time or address, we recommend that you contact the job-seeker. If you need to change the type of job, or the number of hours a job will take, we recommend that you remove the job and upload a new one.",
    "faq.company.question_6": "How do I withdraw a job if I realise that a need no longer exists?",
    "faq.company.answer_6": "Answer: You can remove a job by emailing: help@justarrived.se until you have accepted a job-seeker.",
    "faq.company.question_7": "Why do I need to \"Approve\" when a job is completed?",
    "faq.company.answer_7": "Answer: You approve a job so that we know that it has been completed. As soon as both parties have confirmed that a job has been completed, we can send an invoice and start the wage payment process.",
    "faq.company.question_8": "How do I guarantee that a job has been completed?",
    "faq.company.answer_8": "Answer: The service is based on trust and mutual respect between job-seekers and employers. The service has a rating system that ensures quality is high and that the desire to do a good job is strong. In the event of a dispute concerning a job, we will handle it",
    "faq.company.question_9": "How do I pay for the service?",
    "faq.company.answer_9": "Answer: We invoice employers for completed jobs. Invoices are sent to the email address provided at registration. We provide the job name as a reference. It is not possible to pay with a payment card of Swish. ",
