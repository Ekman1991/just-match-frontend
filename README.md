## Setting up a development environment

1. Install npm modules with `npm install`
2. Install bower and grunt with `sudo npm install -g bower && sudo npm install -g grunt-cli`
3. Install bower dependencies with `bower install`
4. Start a development server with `grunt watch`

You now have a NodeJS webserver accepting requests at [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000) and a server on /api proxying to api.example.com.
